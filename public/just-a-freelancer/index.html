<h1>Just a Freelancer</h1>

<br><br>
<p>I am in the process of prepraring for an interview at a &ldquo;Big Tech Company,&rdquo;
and while I&rsquo;m doing pretty well on the technical stuff, I find that
I struggle a lot with the non-technical questions. Normally, I love
talking about myself, but I find that I am really unsure of which examples
to use and how to present them. I get tongue-tied and talk myself into
a corner.</p>
<p>Then I saw <a href="https://youtu.be/Lm7fb4zrz54">this YouTube video</a> by Peter
McKinnon, an amazingly accomplished YouTuber, about the idea that he can&rsquo;t
be as good as professional videographers because he&rsquo;s &ldquo;just a YouTuber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;ve struggled with the idea that I&rsquo;m not
a legit coder. Not even in this process. But the video did a great job of
encapsulating why someone who isn&rsquo;t a member of a big company would feel
like they weren&rsquo;t the real deal.</p>
<p>McKinnon ends the video by asserting that all the amazing YouTubers he
features in the ending montage don&rsquo;t need to worry about their legitimacy
because what they product speaks for itself. In his case, the imposter
syndrome came up when he was invited to film a Hyundai car commercial.</p>
<p>Now, you were probably expecting this to be a feel-good post about how I&rsquo;m
just as good a coder as the professionals, and now I feel like I can go
into that interview and be myself, secure in the knowledge that I&rsquo;m good
enough.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not how this is going to go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as good as the professionals. McKinnon&rsquo;s assertion is based on the
fact that great YouTubers have created professional quality content, and
generally lots of it. I have not done that. I&rsquo;ve written only three pieces
of software more than a couple files in size that have ever seen the light
of day and been touched by users. One for NASA, one for a research lab at
CU Boulder, and one for PopSockets, which has since been retired.</p>
<p>And honestly, I&rsquo;m pretty annoyed at everyone who says I&rsquo;m a great coder
and that I&rsquo;m just dealing with imposter syndrome.</p>
