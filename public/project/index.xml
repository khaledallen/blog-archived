  Goals The goal of this project was:
 To build a tool for myself to support my educational objectives that I could use regularly To test out an idea I had about mathematics knowledge being structured like code, with inheritance and relationships, rather than a linear process of building towards a big proof or result To gain familiarity with Django (this was my first time working with Django) To expose myself to a CSS framework other than Bootstrap  Overview This project is a Django app that allows me to document mathematics knowledge in a way similar to how I document code.</description>

      <description>Project Notebook Github, includes STL
Final Demo  Goal The goal of this project was to build a sunrise simulation lamp using an Arduino and a Neopixel ring. This is essentially a proof of concept, since I would probably want to use a much bigger Neopixel ring for a real lamp. This one also has a real-time clock board (RTC) that enables the device to keep time even when the Arduino is not drawing power.</description>

      <title>Raspberry Pi Parsec Gaming Client</title>

      <description>This is a project to use a Raspberry Pi to stream games from my CLX gaming PC to various locations in the house using Parsec.
Software Getting the Raspberry Pi to act as a streaming solution wasn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as the instructions from Parsec indicated. The biggest issues we faced (I did this with my friend Sam Cipriani) were latency from attempting to stream a graphics intensive application into the Pi, and then output that onto a big, high resolution TV screen.</description>
