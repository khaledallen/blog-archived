# Learning how to learn

To succeed in college, students need to impose a structure on their own learning. My second run through college was much, much more fruitful than my first because I knew this going in (though not to the level I do now). I had to increase the rate of my feedback cycle, which meant starting my homework early, questioning my approach to it, going to office hours, and interacting with professors frequently. Grades were the worst feedback mechanism because they were relatively infrequent and if they indicated a problem, we were already past the material they had been testing.

Imposing structure on material is an important skill for any learner to master, especially a lifelong self-learner. In general, most experiences in life are not well-structured for learning, and college does not teach it.

In fact, I don't know if there is really any formal approach to structuring self-learning. It's a skill people seem to have or they don't. I had a great high school, so I never had to learn how to learn, and all the advice I found on it had more to do with the neurology and psychology of learning, rather than specific actions with goals.
