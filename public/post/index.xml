      <description>Last month, I completed my commercial pilot checkride and earned my certificate. Along the way, I matured as a pilot in ways that I did not expect. I thought that I would simply learn a few new maneuvers and become more precise, but what I actually learned was an entirely new way to think about flying, thanks to an accident that occurred.
During a training flight, an instructor and I inadvertently starved the plane&amp;rsquo;s engine of fuel, resulting in an engine-out landing in a corn field that totaled the aircraft.</description>

      <description>Hollow Knight is one of my favorite games, even though it is also one of the most difficult I&amp;rsquo;ve ever played. But it is so well-designed that the difficulty doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel unfair. Your pause screen clearly indicates empty spaces for powers and upgrades you have yet to find.
The most difficult areas and bosses are closed to you until you have the abilities you need to beat them. In some cases, you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to try a harder section or boss before you have all the power-ups, but there are no penalties for failing in these cases (not even losing a life).</description>

      <description>I recently finished playing through Halo 2&amp;rsquo;s legendary co-op campaign, which, for those who are not masochistic gamers, is considered one of the most poorly balanced, excessively difficult games ever made. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t played, imagine being a delicate butterfly, made of crystal, trying to survive in a rock tumbler. With another butterfly. Who is tied to your wings, so when one of you dies, you both do. And the rocks are actually trying to hit you.</description>

      <title>Problem Solving Process</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been preparing for a coding interview recently, and as a result I have given a lot of thought to how I tend to solve problems.
When I started back in to school, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a great problem-solving process. I had always been &amp;ldquo;the smart kid&amp;rdquo; and didn&amp;rsquo;t need to do anything special that I was aware of in order to solve most of the problems I encountered. The only exception to that was some of the very difficult games I like to play.</description>

      <description>Last year, I had the amazing opportunity to intern at a NASA center. They were looking for someone with JavaScript experience to update a data collections tool that had been underutilized because it was not searchable and had a poor UI. The plan was to rebuild it with a shiny new graph-based database and to update the frontend to use React. Basically, modernize it and clean it up.
All this was what my supervisors and their bosses wanted.</description>

      <title>Cats Are Evil</title>

      <description>We have a new cat whose name is probably the most on-the-nose name a cat can have: Misjif. He&amp;rsquo;s so mischievious he even spelled mischief wrong.
Take all the things that make cats cat-like&amp;ndash;climbs everything, yowls in the middle of the night, clever in all the wrong ways, velociraptor-like learning curve and love of mayhem&amp;ndash;and turn them up to CAT. That is Misjif. Also cute. He&amp;rsquo;s stinkin&#39; adorable, which makes all of this worse: you can&amp;rsquo;t stay mad at him (though trust me I&amp;rsquo;m working really hard on that).</description>

      <description>When I started learning to bake bread, I used active dry yeast. It was easy and with the right recipe, I could get reasonably good results without all the complications of a sourdough starter. But I always aspired to make bread with the starter, and for a while, I believed that using a starter was the only real way to make bread. I also thought that once I moved to using a starter, I would never make bread the &amp;ldquo;easy way&amp;rdquo; again.</description>

      <description>In 2013, I decided to stop writing regularly in my blog, which I had been posting to daily since 2009 when I graduated college. I had what should have felt like success with a reasonable audience, an ebook and launch, collaborations, guest posts, even some money from my writing.
Then, in 2013 I stopped abruptly. I suddenly found the act of expressing my opinions offensive and exhausting, just a lot of ego-stroking.</description>
