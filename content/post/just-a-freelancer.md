I'm in the process of prepraring for an interview at a "Big Tech Company,"
and while I'm doing pretty well on the technical stuff, I find that
I struggle a lot with the non-technical questions. Normally, I love
talking about myself, but I find that I am really unsure of which examples
to use and how to present them. I get tongue-tied and talk myself into
a corner.

Then I saw [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Lm7fb4zrz54) by Peter
McKinnon, an amazingly accomplished YouTuber, about the idea that he can't
be as good as professional videographers because he's "just a YouTuber."

This isn't the first time I've struggled with the idea that I'm not
a legit coder. Not even in this process. But the video did a great job of
encapsulating why someone who isn't a member of a big company would feel
like they weren't the real deal.

McKinnon ends the video by asserting that all the amazing YouTubers he
features in the ending montage don't need to worry about their legitimacy
because what they product speaks for itself. In his case, the imposter
syndrome came up when he was invited to film a Hyundai car commercial.

Now, you were probably expecting this to be a feel-good post about how I'm
just as good a coder as the professionals, and now I feel like I can go
into that interview and be myself, secure in the knowledge that I'm good
enough.

But that's not how this is going to go.

I'm not as good as the professionals. McKinnon's assertion is based on the
fact that great YouTubers have created professional quality content, and
generally lots of it. I have not done that. I've written only three pieces
of software more than a couple files in size that have ever seen the light
of day and been touched by users. One for NASA, one for a research lab at
CU Boulder, and one for PopSockets, which has since been retired.

And honestly, I'm pretty annoyed at everyone who says I'm a great coder
and that I'm just dealing with imposter syndrome.
